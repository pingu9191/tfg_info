# 🏎️ Telemetry Analysis for iRacing

This project aims to create a predective model able to predict lap-time during an stint of any driver. It will be able to handle live recorded telemetry from iRacing and train or use a predective model able to estimate lap time.

In the future it will be analyzed if it is able to add to analyze driving styles and driving errors or inconsistences as well as interesting exporting data.

## 📊 Objective

- Analyze telemetry data to identify driving patterns.
- Detect anomalies in driver performance (mistakes, overtakes, fatigue, etc.).
- Automatically generate reports that explain where and why time is lost.
- Monitor performance consistency and evolution during a session in real time.

## ⚙️ Technologies

- Python 3.x  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (visualization)  
- Scikit-learn (ML & anomaly detection)
- TensorFlow (ANN)
- Jupyter Notebooks  
- Git

## 📁 Project Structure
- data: folder where csv (too large) are located
- out: exports of the program
- src: code
- tracks: json files with sections of a track

# 🏎️ Telemetry Analysis for iRacing (Work In Progress)

This project aims to create a predictive model capable of estimating lap times during a driver's stint in iRacing. It can process live-recorded telemetry and train or apply models to evaluate performance.

Future versions will explore the detection of driving styles, errors, and inconsistencies, as well as exporting insightful reports from the data.

## 📊 Objectives

- Analyze telemetry data to identify driving patterns  
- Detect anomalies in driver performance (mistakes, fatigue, inconsistencies, etc.)  
- Build predictive models for lap time estimation  
- Generate detailed performance reports automatically
